//
// The evaluator to use is derived from the *shape* of the position — board
// bounds, piece composition, obstacle density, promotion lines — rather than
// the `[Variant "…"]` meta tag, which is often absent. `detect` runs once per
// received position (at the end of `GameState::setup_position_from_icn`, after
// any moves are replayed) and caches its result in `GameState::eval_kind`, so
// the per-node `evaluate` dispatch is a single enum match with no board
// scanning. Because it reflects the *current* board, a position's kind can
// change over a game — e.g. Obstocean reverts to the base evaluator once its
// obstacles clear, and Pawn Horde does so once promotions outweigh the pawns.
